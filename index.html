	<h2>2 Good and 2 Bad interfaces</h2>
</div>
<div class="section idea">
Examples of Good and Bad User Interfaces
An example of a poor user interface is the touch screen interface is modern luxury cars. The transition from analog to digital took a wrong turn as car companies and car dashboard designers decided to make car interiors more advanced. Formerly, cars only needed so many devices to function properly. Before FM/AM radio transmission was possible, car stereos were unneeded, but as technologies evolved, more things could be fit into a car interior. Stereos, climate control, windows, seat heating, video devices, external audio inputs, charging stations, and car diagnostic tools are among the few additions to car interiors throughout the last few decades. These devices added clutter and mayhem to the dashboard, and needed to be resolved functionally and aesthetically. Seemingly in pair with the smartphone touchscreen agenda, manufacturers decided to implement touchscreen technology to overcome the overwhelming amount of physical controls, dials, knobs, sliders and buttons on the dashboard. The obvious advantage to using a touchscreen interface is the ability to nest and layer menus. Now the user could decide which aspect of the car they wanted to manipulate, and see all the available options on one screen, not being hampered by superfluous potential choices. However, the major fault of this design choice is that the primary operator of the device is the driver, not the passenger, which means the user will not have the option to observe the screen for extended periods of time. Previously, a driver had the ability to become familiar with physical placement, shape and characteristics of the device he wished to operate, not needing to take his eyes off the road. Now, the physical landscape of the dashboard is simplified into 1 flat panel with no tacit feedback. This issue has been mitigated somewhat by the addition of auxiliary buttons elsewhere in the car, such as the steering wheel, but it persists as real problem for drivers everywhere.

Another symbolic emergence of the digital age from the analog era is the modern QWERTY keyboard. My issue with this contraption is that it is based off of nothing. It is nearly impossible to learn quickly, and the learning process is frustrating, and based entirely in trial and error. There is nothing about the current keyboard layout that suggest it is easy to use or needs to be the way it is. The home row concept is not actually justified, and unfortunately, people just have to accept it and move on because there effectively no other alternatives. Even if someone wanted to change their keyboard layout, which they could, it would involve relearning the entire process. Obviously, the education system enforces the use of the QWERTY keyboard during childhood, which makes it hard to switch. This isn’t the first or only time that the education system has enforced an unjustified and unproven methodology on generations of children, but that is its own debate. Ideally, each child would have his own typing method that he would develop, and this would translate to the keyboard layout. Also, why are the shift alt and control keys so awkwardly grouped on the right side? I literally never use them.

An example of a good user interface is the spacebar activated menu that exists in Autodesk Maya. Maya is a 3d development, animation and rendering suite, a complete solution for games and film, among other applications. By the nature of the software, there are thousands of possible actions available to the user at any one time, from which the user can take an additional thousand paths to achieve their desired result. The number of menus, drop downs, slider, windows (which can be reorganized into dozens of layouts and configurations) and buttons are a testament to Maya’s power and versatility, but also a testament to its incredibly difficult learning curve. The sheer quantity of options are overwhelming, maybe even excessive. There are 3 ways to reach any menu option in Maya. The user can right click on an object and open its attributes in a collapsible menu that floats to the right of the screen, the user can select a drop down menu in the top-left of the screen and pick a topic that populates the top of the screen with more drop down options, or ideally, the user can hold the space bar. Holding down the space-bar brings up a floating overlay of every possible action in Autodesk Maya, even if that action cannot be performed on the selected object. The menu is organized into tabs that float in the center of the screen, and are only visible if space is held down. From this menu, the user can click and hold down the left mouse button on a menu option to reveal a drop-down menu that encompasses all the available options for that menu item. For a power user, this tool is unforgeable, it allows speedy access to any menu in the application, and is organized sensibly, with high visibility and correlates the locations of them menus in the software if you were to look for them normally. This interface is fast, effective, sensibly organized, relatively easy to learn, and only gets better as you learn to use it.

The last good interface I will analyze is the acoustic guitar. The guitar is a fascinating instrument that has advantages over many other instruments, mainly due to its impressive design and excellence as an interface between people and sound. The first impressive aspect of the guitar is its range; the guitar spans 4 octaves, thanks to the design which places 6 strings right next to each other. Since it’s a stringed instrument, the guitar can be configured on a string by string basis to change its tone, and even expand its octave range. This, in combination with the fact that 6 strings side by side allow the user the play combinations of notes (chords), trumps many other instruments, aside from the piano, which allows chords and spans a 7 octave range. The guitar also allows for both discrete and continuous production of sound. The fretboard inherently allows the user to precisely generate discrete note frequencies. Furthermore, the tuning pegs on the head of the guitar allow the user to change the overall tuning of the instrument, or change the tuning of an individual note. Lastly, the body of the guitar is ergonomic and allows the user to hold and use it comfortably for extended periods of time.

<div class="section idea">
    <h3>
        Digital Audio Workstation
    </h3>

    <p>
        The idea behind this project would be to take my experience developing gui's and my working knowledge
        of digital audio workstation software, such as my personal favorite, Propellorhead Reason, and others such as
        Fruity Loops, Logic, GarageBand, and Ableton.
        All of these programs have a few things in common that make are the foundation of all DAW's:
        A mixer full of available audio channels, which in turn are hooked up to units that produce or alter sound,
        and lastly some sort of piano-roll/midi note editor. Midi notes are a type of audio programming that
        allows for a computer to generate a sound (whether from a file or through a synthesizer) whenever
        a "MIDI note" is seen at a certain position in time. It is effectively simplified digital sheet music
        represented on a piano-roll. I would start this project by developing this piano roll GUI, adding in
        functionality
        to create, delete, resize, move, cut and splice the notes themselves, then hook them up to actual audio.

    <h3>
        Redone/Enhanced personal website
    </h3>

    <p>
        My personal website at the moment is very lacking, I have been failing at keeping up on updating it over the
        last
        year and a half.
        However, my personal skills, abilities, experiences and creations have amassed, and need to be accurately
        represented.
        This project would involve thinking out a flexible, immersive and dynamic GUI for my personal site that would
        represent myself
        better than ever. It would involve many components and pages for my personal projects, such as coding, music,
        digital and traditional art,
        photography, links to existing projects/demos, a bio, contact information and of course the experience itself
        would
        aim to be novel
        and unique but likewise flexibile and usable.

    <h3>
        Star Map
    </h3>

    <p>
        This idea is more of a shot in the dark (no pun intended). I would put my skills to use to develop something
        educational
        and fun.
        Essentially a revamp of google sky maps/ star maps, it would take your position on the earth and view the
        celestial sky
        above your head,
        except unlike google's version, this version would allow the user to interact with the sky and its contents. I
        would
        need to find data online
        that I could import dynamically. Data on constellations and basic visible stars/nearby planets would be
        necessary at
        minimum.
        I would find this tool an exciting prospect for developing a truly rich and interactive GUI; it has potential
        for an
        actual unique
        method of use.
