Metaphors:
<br><br>1)	Browsing through a newspaper, trying to find the news section. Once you find the news section, looking through the individual stories and columns, trying to find something that will interest you, instead of just being fed information. 
<br><br>2)	Comparing and contrasting article from different news sources by opening multiple windows side by side. 
<br><br>3)	Sorting through a big pile of Lego pieces, trying to find specific ones that go together, either due to color, shape or size. 
<br><br>4)	Looking through your pantry for specific ingredients to a dish you are trying to make with little to no time. 
<br><br><br>
Activity Scenarios<br>
<br>1)	Andy, a college student, comes home from a long day of classes. He is tired, but wants to catch up on some global current events. Andy opens NewsAggregator and sees the last 3 days of news visualized on the map. However, Andy needs to see today’s news. He selects the time slider, and moves it to the current date. Andy’s screen is populated by icons depicting today’s news events. Andy finds an article that interests him, describing the events in Syria. Andy wants to see similar stories, so he selects the news article that interests him, clicks “filter” and prints the stories he wanted to see. Then Andy goes to bed.
<br><br>2)	Sandy is a young urban professional working in the finance sector of downtown Boston. She is having a busy day, but noon rolls around and Sandy wants to eat lunch, relax, and get up to speed on global current events. Sandy doesn’t have the time to open the same news article from multiple sources; especially not when she’s eating delicious chicken parmesan. Sandy launches NewsAggregator.com and sees numerous interesting articles, from today’s date, all around the world. One article in particular interests her, a story of renewable energy usage in Germany. She sees information that she wants to verify with other sources, so Sandy clicks on the article, and selects the news sources she wishes to check. Now Sandy can rest easy knowing that Germany indeed does utilize renewable energy the way she expected from the first article she read. 
<br><br>3)	Mike, a middle aged immigrant from Ukraine, is dining out at Red Lobster, alone. Mike is rather lonely, but has the NewsAggregator WebApp to help him stay informed and knowledgeable on world events. Mike has been fascinated by the Ebola crisis in Africa, and is worried it may spread to Ukraine, and affect his family. He has been tracking the growth of Ebola cases throughout the world by comparing the dates of dozens of articles on our WebApp. He launches the app, and sees that another case of doctors dying to Ebolavirus has popped up in Turkey. Worried that this may lead to more problems, he selects the time slider range handles, and moves them apart by 1 week. He can clearly see all news stories related to Ebola within the last week, visualized on the map. He can also observe that no other stories apart from todays have popped up anywhere near Turkey. Using this information, Mike can assume his family is safe, and eat his lobster in peace.

	<h2>Final Project Proposal</h2>
</div>
<div class="section idea">

Problem:<br>
Users need a way to browse the internet and see news sources displayed from various sources, and visualized on a map.
Typically, users will need to go to numerous websites to get information on world events, and even then, 
users will not know the reliability of the information and need a way to cross reference it. Also,
there is no way to quickly see a collection of world events, on a day-by-day basis, visualized on a map, geographically.
<br><br>
Target Users: <br>
The target user of this application is anyone who wishes to read global news, anyone who wishes to see these events visualized on a map,
with relationships based on various options as well as a way to filter the news articles. Mainly this is for users
who need a way to see the same news article from multiple sources, and to be able to quickly read and compare these articles
to verify the validity of the statement being made. 
<br><br>
Solution: <br>
The solution is a web application developed in Javascript, CSS/SASS/SCSS, and HTML/Handlebars. The solution will be based
on the Yeoman Web App generator, and make use of node package manager to employ SASS (syntactically awesome style sheets)
and Handlebars (an html static site web templating language). These components, along with JQuery standard GUI tools,
will allow us to create a webapp that is useable on any device, and has a responsive GUI that adapts to different screen sizes.
This icon below opens up an image that describes the concept art:

<br>
In this image you can observe the following basic GUI components:<br>
-The Filters Panel <br>
--This panel will display all of the ways the user can sort the articles. Geography, Topic and News sources <br>
--will poll data from news source API's (if time permits us to build a backend) <br>
--Data relationships will allow the user to make inferences between articles using keywords and data.
<br><br>
-The Article Panel <br>
--This Panel will display the currently selected article in a mobile version state, to conserve screen space. <br>
--This sections also contains several buttons to give the user more options with the article viewing<br>
<br>
-The Map<br>
--This will take up the most screen space, and display news articles by date (can be changed using the timeline)<Br>
--clicking on an article on the map loads it in the right-side panel, using the mobile version
